# classed-components

> It's 2020 and your roomie and you come up with the idea of yet another app to share your favorite playlists. That interface designer you met a Sameheads last fall owes you a favor for the night they'd forget all their money at home drafts a UI concept that's flat, modern and crisp even though it would only require a few lines of CSS to rebuild this in code. You've heard that _CSS-in-JS_ is a thing and realize it's a breeze builing your UI from scratch using `styled-components`. Life is good ✌️
