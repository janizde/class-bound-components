# classed-components

The glue between component interfaces for styles and CSS-in-CSS.

> It's 2020 and your roomie and you come up with the idea of yet another app to share your favorite playlist. That interface designer you met a Sameheads last fall owes you a favor for the night they forgot all their money and cards in their WG sublet and in exchange draft a UI concept that's flat, modern and crisp in only two hours. You've heard that _CSS-in-JS_ is a thing and realize it's a breeze builiding your new UI from scratch using `styled-components`. Life is good ✌️
